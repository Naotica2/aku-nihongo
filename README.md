Hey there! So, here's the lowdown on this project:

**What's the deal?**

This is a simple web app that lets you type in some text in Indonesian, translates it to Japanese using Google's Translation API, and then plays a random prank sound when you hit the "Speak" button.

**How's it built?**

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The usual trio for building the web interface and making things interactive.

- **Google Cloud Translation API**: This is the magic behind the translation. It takes your Indonesian text and converts it to Japanese.

**How does it work?**

1. **Type your text**: You enter some Indonesian text into the input box.

2. **Translate it**: When you click the "Translate" button, the app sends your text to Google's Translation API, which returns the Japanese version.

3. **See the translation**: The Japanese text pops up on the screen.

4. **Play a prank sound**: If you click the "Speak" button, instead of reading out the translation, the app plays a random prank sound from a set of MP3 files.

**What about the code?**

- **translateText() function**: This function grabs your input, sends it to the Google Translation API, and then displays the translated text.

- **speakText() function**: This one picks a random prank sound from a list and plays it when you click "Speak".

**Heads up!**

To use Google's Translation API, you'll need to set up a project in the Google Cloud Console, enable the API, and get an API key. Make sure to handle this key securely and be aware of any usage limits or costs.

This project is a fun way to combine translation services with some lighthearted pranking. Enjoy!
